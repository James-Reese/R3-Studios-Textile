This is framework for an Open Source [ Text-Based : Turn-Based : Open World ] video game for PC and other consoles. Once this code is stable, internal development will continue under a closed branch. Please note, this is currently in an experimental and pre-production stage. At this point in time, I am using it to learn Python and make something I can play with, and continue build on over the years to possibly have a huge Python based video game. I like simplicity when it is well design and crafted, the quote I follow when making something is that perfection is not achieved by how much you can add to something, but how much you can take away while also making better.
